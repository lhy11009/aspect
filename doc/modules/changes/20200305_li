New: Visco-plastic material model can now have phases in a single compostion leading to
mupliple phases and compostions in total. To do this, user need to give additional
values in 'subsection Material model'. First, user need to provide information about
phase transitions, this is one example:
'set Phase transition depths = background:50e3|75e3, right:50e3|75e3'
Note that composition is marked with name 'background' and 'right' while phases are
separated by '|'.
Then, user need to provide information about material properties, this is one example:
'set Densities = background:3300|3400|3500, right:3600|3700|3800'
Note that, for each composition, entries for properties should be one more than entries
of phase transitions.
If these entries are provided, the program will calculate density and viscosity by averaging
among phases.
